# Chapter 2 Assignment: Chat Models & Basic Interactions

## Overview

Practice multi-turn conversations, streaming, parameters, and error handling to build robust AI applications.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Chapter 2](./README.md)
- Run all four code examples
- Understand conversation history management

---

## Challenge: Interactive Chatbot 🤖

**Goal**: Build a chatbot that maintains conversation history across multiple exchanges.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `chatbot.ts` in the `02-chat-models/code/` folder
2. Implement an interactive chatbot that:
   - Accepts user input in a loop
   - Maintains conversation history
   - Allows users to type "quit" to exit
   - Shows the conversation history length after each exchange
3. Use a SystemMessage to give the bot a personality (you choose!)

**Example Interaction**:
```
🤖 Chatbot: Hello! I'm your helpful assistant. Ask me anything!

You: What is Node.js?
🤖: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime...

You: Can you show me an example?
🤖: Sure! Here's a simple Node.js example...

You: quit
👋 Goodbye! We had 5 messages in our conversation.
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Bot remembers previous messages
- Conversation history is maintained correctly
- User can exit gracefully

## Bonus Challenge: Temperature Experiment 🌡️

**Goal**: Understand how temperature affects AI creativity and consistency.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `temperature-lab.ts`
2. Test the same creative prompt with 5 different temperature values: 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2
3. Run each temperature 3 times to see variability
4. Display results in a readable format
5. Add your analysis of which temperature works best for different use cases

**Creative Prompt Ideas**:
- "Write a tagline for a coffee shop"
- "Create a name for a tech startup"
- "Suggest a title for a mystery novel"

**Expected Output**:
```
🌡️ Temperature: 0
─────────────────────────────────────
Try 1: "Brew Your Best Day"
Try 2: "Brew Your Best Day"
Try 3: "Brew Your Best Day"

🌡️ Temperature: 2
─────────────────────────────────────
Try 1: "Caffeinated Dreams Await"
Try 2: "Sip the Extraordinary"
Try 3: "Where Magic Meets Mocha"

📊 Analysis:
- Temperature 0: Perfect for factual, consistent responses
- Temperature 2: Great for creative brainstorming
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Tests at least 5 temperature values
- Shows variability clearly
- Includes your analysis of results

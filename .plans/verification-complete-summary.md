## Verification Results by Chapter

### Chapter 2: Chat Models ✅

**Examples Verified** (5/5):
- ✅ `01-multi-turn.ts` - Multi-turn conversations work correctly
- ✅ `02-streaming.ts` - Streaming responses work, shows timing comparisons
- ✅ `03-parameters.ts` - Temperature comparisons (0, 1, 2) demonstrate creativity control
- ✅ `05-error-handling.ts` - Error handling with `withRetry()` works correctly
- ✅ `06-token-tracking.ts` - Token usage tracking works with v1 API

**Updates Made**:
- Updated token-tracking expected output in README.md:2:463-465
  - Changed from: `Prompt tokens: 12, Completion tokens: 45, Total: 57`
  - Changed to: `Prompt tokens: 17, Completion tokens: 59, Total: 76`
  - Reason: Actual execution produces different token counts

**"How It Works" Sections**: All accurate and explain v1 code correctly

## Summary Statistics

### Files Verified
- **Total TypeScript files tested**: 37
- **All examples executed successfully**: ✅
- **Build status**: ✅ Passing (64 files, 0 errors)

### README Updates
- **Chapter 2**: 1 output update (token tracking counts)
- **Chapters 3-7**: No output updates needed

### Code Quality
- ✅ All v1 import patterns verified
- ✅ All v1 API usage verified
- ✅ Type safety verified across all examples
- ✅ Error handling patterns verified
- ✅ All "How It Works" sections accurate

---

## Key Insights from Verification

### 1. Token Usage Variability
Token counts can vary slightly between runs due to:
- Prompt variations in phrasing
- Model response variations
- Context changes
- **Action**: Updated README with actual current output

### 2. All Examples Production-Ready
Every example demonstrates:
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Type safety
- ✅ Clear educational value
- ✅ Consistent v1 patterns

### 3. Documentation Quality
- Code examples in READMEs match actual `.ts` files
- "Expected Output" sections are realistic
- "How It Works" sections explain the actual v1 code accurately

---

## Verification Methodology

For each chapter:
1. ✅ Listed all TypeScript example files
2. ✅ Executed each file to capture actual output
3. ✅ Compared output with README "Expected Output" sections
4. ✅ Updated README where outputs didn't match
5. ✅ Verified "How It Works" sections explain current code
6. ✅ Confirmed v1 patterns throughout

---

## Student Experience Impact

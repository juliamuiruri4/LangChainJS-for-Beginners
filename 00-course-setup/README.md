## üìñ The Workshop Analogy

**Imagine you're about to start building a custom piece of furniture.**

Before you start cutting wood or assembling pieces, you need to:
- üîß **Set up your workbench** (Install Node.js)
- üîë **Get access to the hardware store** (GitHub token for AI models)
- üì¶ **Gather your materials** (Install dependencies)
- üìã **Organize your blueprints** (Configure environment variables)
- üõ†Ô∏è **Prepare your tools** (Set up your code editor)

**Would you start building without these?** Of course not!

The same applies to AI development. This setup chapter ensures you have:

- ‚úÖ A solid foundation to build on
- ‚úÖ Access to the AI models you need
- ‚úÖ All tools properly configured
- ‚úÖ A smooth development experience

**Let's get your workshop ready!** In just 15 minutes, you'll be equipped to build powerful AI applications.

## Setup Options

Choose from one of the following options to set up your development environment:

1. **GitHub Codespaces**: Use a cloud-based development environment.
2. **Local Development**: Set up your environment on your machine.

---

## GitHub Codespaces

If you prefer not to set up your local environment, you can use **GitHub Codespaces** which is a cloud-based development environment that runs in your browser.
 
1. **Create a Codespace**: Open the [langchainjs-for-beginners](https://github.com/danwahlin/langchainjs-for-beginners) on GitHub and click on the green "Code" button. Select "Open with Codespaces" and "New codespace".
2. **Wait for Initialization**: It will take a few moments to set up your environment.
3. **Access the Terminal**: Once ready, open the terminal in Codespaces (Terminal > New Terminal).

---

## Local Development

### Step 1: Install Node.js

You'll need **Node.js LTS (Long Term Support)** to run LangChain.js applications.

#### Check if Node.js is installed:

```bash
node --version
```

If you see an LTS version number (visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to check), you're good! Skip to Step 2.

#### Install Node.js:

1. Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Follow the install instructions for your operating system
3. Verify installation:

```bash
node --version  # Displays LTS version
npm --version # Displays npm version
```

**Why LTS?**

- ‚úÖ **Stable**: Production-ready and well-tested
- ‚úÖ **Supported**: Receives security updates and bug fixes
- ‚úÖ **Reliable**: Recommended for all applications
- ‚úÖ **Compatible**: Works with all LangChain.js packages

---

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the course repository
git clone https://github.com/danwahlin/langchainjs-for-beginners

# Navigate to the project
cd langchainjs-for-beginners

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install tsx globally
npm install -g tsx
```

This will install all required packages:
- `@langchain/openai` - OpenAI integration
- `@langchain/core` - Core LangChain functionality
- `@langchain/langgraph` - Agent workflow orchestration
- `langchain` - Main LangChain package
- `dotenv` - Environment variable management

#### Why install tsx globally?

**tsx** is a TypeScript execution engine that lets you run `.ts` files directly without compiling them first.

**Without tsx**:
```bash
# You'd need to compile first, then run
tsc myfile.ts        # Compile TypeScript ‚Üí JavaScript
node myfile.js       # Run the JavaScript file
```

**With tsx** (what we'll use):
```bash
# Run TypeScript files directly - no compilation step needed!
tsx myfile.ts
```

**Benefits**:

- ‚úÖ **Faster development** - No compile step needed
- ‚úÖ **Simpler workflow** - One command instead of two
- ‚úÖ **Global installation** - Available everywhere on your system
- ‚úÖ **Perfect for learning** - Focus on code, not build processes

Throughout this course, you'll run examples using `tsx filename.ts` - quick and easy!

---

### Step 3: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

GitHub Models provides free access to powerful AI models‚Äîyou just need a Personal Access Token.

#### Create Your Token:

1. **Visit**: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. **Token name**: `langchain-course` (or any name you prefer)
3. **Expiration**: Choose your preference (90 days recommended for learning)
4. **Scopes/Permissions**:
   - ‚úÖ No scopes needed for GitHub Models!
   - You can leave all checkboxes unchecked
5. **Click**: "Generate token"
6. **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Copy your token now and save it to a text file temporarily! You'll need it in the next step.

#### Why GitHub Models?

- ‚úÖ **Free**: No credit card required
- ‚úÖ **Powerful**: Access to GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and other models
- ‚úÖ **Easy**: Use your existing GitHub account
- ‚úÖ **Learning**: Perfect for this course!

---

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

#### Create `.env` file:

**Mac, Linux, WSL on Windows:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Windows Command Prompt:**

```bash
# Windows Command Prompt
copy .env.example .env

# Windows PowerShell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

#### Edit `.env` file:

Open `.env` in your text editor and configure your AI provider.

**For GitHub Models (Free - Recommended):**

```bash
AI_API_KEY=ghp_your_github_token_here
AI_ENDPOINT=https://models.inference.ai.azure.com
AI_MODEL=gpt-5-mini
```

**Replace `ghp_your_github_token_here` with your actual GitHub token!**

### Alternative: Azure AI Foundry (Optional)

If you have an Azure subscription, you can use Azure AI Foundry for production-grade AI applications with enterprise features.

#### Step-by-Step Setup:

You can follow the steps below to deploy models in Azure AI Foundry or visit the [Deploy an Azure OpenAI model quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/quickstarts/get-started-code?tabs=azure-ai-foundry) which will also walk you through the process.

**1. Create an Azure AI Foundry Project**

1. Visit the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/)
2. Sign in with your Azure account
3. Click **+ New project**
4. Fill in the project details:
   - **Project name**: `langchain-course` (or your preferred name)
   - **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription
   - **Resource group**: Create new or select existing
   - **Region**: Choose a region close to you (e.g., East US, West Europe)
5. Click **Create** (the portal will automatically set up the necessary resources)

**2. Deploy Required Models**

You'll need to deploy two models for this course:

**Deploy gpt-5-mini & gpt-5 (Chat Model):**

1. In your project, go to **Models + endpoints** in the left navigation
2. Click **+ Deploy model** ‚Üí **Deploy base model**
3. Search for and select **gpt-5-mini**
4. Click **Confirm**
5. Configure deployment:
   - **Deployment name**: `gpt-5-mini` (keep this name for consistency)
   - **Model version**: Select the latest available
   - **Deployment type**: Global Standard
   - Click **Deploy**
6. Wait for deployment to complete
7. Follow the same process and deploy `gpt-5` as well

**Deploy Text Embedding Model:**

1. Click **+ Deploy model** ‚Üí **Deploy base model** again
2. Search for and select **text-embedding-3-small**
3. Click **Confirm**
4. Configure deployment:
   - **Deployment name**: `text-embedding-3-small` (keep this name)
   - **Model version**: Select the latest available
   - **Deployment type**: Global Standard
   - Click **Deploy**
5. Wait for deployment to complete

**3. Get Your Configuration Values**

After deploying your models, you need two pieces of information:

1. **API Key**:
   - In your project, go to **Overview** in the left navigation
   - Find **Endpoints and keys**
   - Locate your **API Key**

2. **Endpoint URL**:
   - Locate the **Azure OpenAI** ‚Üí **Azure OpenAI endpoint** value (looks like: `https://your-resource.openai.azure.com`)

**4. Add the API Key and Endpoint to Your `.env` File:**

Ensure that you add `/openai/v1` to the end of your endpoint URL.

```bash
# Azure AI Foundry Configuration
AI_API_KEY=your_azure_api_key_here
AI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/v1
```

**Important Notes:**

- ‚úÖ **Deployment names must match**: The course uses `gpt-5-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small` as deployment names
- ‚úÖ **Keep your API key secure**: Never commit `.env` to version control
- ‚úÖ **Cost management**: Azure AI Foundry is a paid service. Set up cost alerts in the Azure portal
- ‚úÖ **Production ready**: Azure AI Foundry provides enterprise features like Responsible AI, monitoring, logging, and SLA guarantees

- [Model Deployment Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/deploy-models)



### Step 5: Test Your Setup

Let's verify everything works!

#### Run the test:

Run the following command in your terminal from the root of the project:

```bash
tsx scripts/test-setup.ts
```

#### Expected output:

```
üöÄ Testing AI provider connection...

‚úÖ SUCCESS! Your AI provider is working!
   Provider: https://models.inference.ai.azure.com
   Model: gpt-5-mini

Model response: Setup successful!

üéâ You're ready to start the course!
```

If you see this, you're all set! If not, check the troubleshooting section below.

### Step 6: Install VS Code (Recommended)

While you can use any text editor, we recommend **Visual Studio Code** for the best experience.

#### Install VS Code:

1. Visit [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download for your OS
3. Install

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot find module '@langchain/openai'"

**Solution**: Run `npm install` in the project directory

### Issue: "AI_API_KEY not found" or "AI_ENDPOINT not found"

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure `.env` file exists in the project root
2. Check that `.env` contains all required variables:
   - `AI_API_KEY=your_key`
   - `AI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint_url`
   - `AI_MODEL=gpt-5-mini`
3. No quotes needed around the values
4. No spaces before or after the `=`

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized" or "Invalid token"

**Solutions**:
1. Create a new GitHub Personal Access Token
2. Make sure you copied the entire token
3. The token should start with `ghp_` or `github_pat_`
4. Check for extra spaces in the `.env` file

### Issue: Rate limit errors

**Solution**: GitHub Models have rate limits. If you hit them:
- Wait a few minutes
- The limits reset quickly
- You can use Azure AI Foundry instead if you went through the optional setup above

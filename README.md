# ü¶úüîó LangChain.js for Beginners

Welcome to **LangChain.js for Beginners** - your complete guide to building AI-powered applications with LangChain.js and TypeScript!

## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll know how to:
- ‚úÖ Create intelligent chatbots with context-aware responses
- ‚úÖ Build semantic search engines that understand meaning
- ‚úÖ Develop AI agents that can reason and use tools autonomously
- ‚úÖ Construct Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- ‚úÖ Integrate function calling and external tools
- ‚úÖ Connect to Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers

## Why LangChain.js?

Think of building an AI application like cooking a gourmet meal. You could source ingredients from scratch, create every sauce from base components, and build your own cooking tools‚Äîor you could use a well-stocked kitchen with quality ingredients and proven recipes. LangChain.js is that well-stocked kitchen for AI development.

LangChain.js provides:
- üîå **Model Flexibility**: Switch between AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, etc.) with minimal code changes
- üß© **Pre-built Components**: Reusable building blocks for common AI patterns
- üîÑ **Easy Integration**: Connect LLMs with your data, APIs, and tools
- üéØ **Production Ready**: Built-in features for monitoring, debugging, and scaling

## Course Structure

This course contains **8 sections** (setup + 7 chapters), each focusing on a specific aspect of LangChain.js:

0. **[Course Setup](./00-course-setup/README.md)** - Get your development environment ready
1. **[Introduction to LangChain.js](./01-introduction/README.md)** - Understanding the framework and core concepts
2. **[Chat Models & Basic Interactions](./02-chat-models/README.md)** - Chat models, messages, and making your first API call
3. **[Prompt Engineering with Templates](./03-prompt-templates/README.md)** - Creating dynamic, reusable prompts
4. **[Documents, Embeddings & Semantic Search](./04-documents-embeddings-semantic-search/README.md)** - Loading documents, creating embeddings, and building semantic search
5. **[Function Calling & Tooling](./05-function-calling-tooling/README.md)** - Extending AI capabilities with function calling and tools
6. **[Building RAG Systems](./06-rag-systems/README.md)** - Combining retrieval with generation using LCEL
7. **[Agents & MCP](./07-agents-mcp/README.md)** - Building autonomous agents and integrating Model Context Protocol

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should be comfortable with:
- JavaScript/TypeScript fundamentals
- Node.js >=22.0.0 (LTS) and npm
- Async/await and Promises
- Basic Generative AI concepts (covered in our "GenAI for JavaScript Developers" course)

## Getting Started

Each chapter is self-contained with:
- üìñ **Conceptual explanations** with real-world analogies
- üíª **Working code examples** you can run immediately
- üéØ **Hands-on challenges** to test your understanding
- üîë **Key takeaways** to reinforce learning

### Setup

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/langchainjs-for-beginners.git

# Navigate to the project
cd langchainjs-for-beginners

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your AI provider credentials
# See .env.example for all options
```

### AI Provider Configuration

**This course is provider-agnostic!** All examples work with:
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Models** (Free - recommended for learning)
- ‚úÖ **Azure AI Foundry** (Production deployments)
- ‚úÖ **OpenAI Direct** (Also production-ready)

Edit `.env` file with three values:

```bash
AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint_url
AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

**No code changes needed to switch providers** - just update `.env`!

üëâ **Start with [Course Setup](./00-course-setup/README.md)** for detailed configuration!

## Learning Path

Each chapter builds on the previous one, but you can also jump to specific topics of interest. We recommend following the sequence for the best learning experience.

**Estimated Time**: 12-15 hours total (including hands-on exercises)

## Testing & Validation

All code examples in this course are automatically tested to ensure they work correctly.

### Build Check

Compile all TypeScript files to check for errors and warnings:

```bash
# Check all files compile without errors
npm run build
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Compile all 98 TypeScript files across all chapters
- ‚úÖ Show type errors and warnings
- ‚úÖ Validate imports and syntax
- ‚úÖ Fast - no API calls, just compilation check

### Runtime Validation

Run all code examples with actual API calls:

```bash
# Validate all code examples
npm test

# Or test individual examples
npx tsx 01-introduction/code/01-hello-world.ts
npx tsx 05-function-calling-tooling/code/01-simple-tool.ts
```

The validation script:
- ‚úÖ Tests all TypeScript examples across all chapters
- ‚úÖ Automatically handles interactive examples with simulated input
- ‚úÖ Provides detailed error reports if issues are found
- ‚úÖ Runs in GitHub Actions when triggered (see below)

**GitHub Actions Validation**: To save CI time and API costs, validation only runs when you include `validate-examples` in your commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "Update RAG examples validate-examples"
```

Or trigger manually via the GitHub Actions UI.

**Note**: Runtime validation requires `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_ENDPOINT`, and `AI_MODEL` environment variables. See [Course Setup](./00-course-setup/README.md) for details.

üìñ **Full Testing Guide**: See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for detailed testing instructions, troubleshooting, and best practices.

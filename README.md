## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Welcome to **LangChain.js for Beginners** - your complete, hands-on guide to building AI-powered applications with LangChain.js and TypeScript!

Think of building an AI application like cooking a gourmet meal. You could source ingredients from scratch, create every sauce from base components, and build your own cooking toolsâ€”or you could use a well-stocked kitchen with quality ingredients and proven recipes. **LangChain.js is that well-stocked kitchen for AI development.**

### What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll know how to:

- âœ… Create intelligent chatbots with streaming responses and conversation memory
- âœ… Engineer effective prompts with templates and few-shot examples
- âœ… Build semantic search engines using embeddings and vector stores
- âœ… Extract structured data from AI responses using Zod schemas
- âœ… Extend AI capabilities with function calling and custom tools
- âœ… Construct Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with LCEL
- âœ… Develop autonomous AI agents that reason and use tools
- âœ… Understand Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI integrations

### Why LangChain.js?

LangChain.js provides:

- ðŸ”Œ **Model Flexibility**: Switch between AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, etc.) with minimal code changes
- ðŸ§© **Pre-built Components**: Reusable building blocks for common AI patterns
- ðŸ”„ **Easy Integration**: Connect LLMs with your data, APIs, and tools
- ðŸŽ¯ **Production Ready**: Built-in features for monitoring, debugging, and scaling

> **New to AI development?** Check out our companion course [**Generative AI with JavaScript**](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-with-javascript) to learn AI fundamentals first!

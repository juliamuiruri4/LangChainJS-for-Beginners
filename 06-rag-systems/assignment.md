# Chapter 6 Assignment: Building RAG Systems

## Overview

Practice building Retrieval Augmented Generation systems that combine document retrieval with LLM generation for accurate, sourced answers.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Chapter 6](./README.md)
- Run all code examples
- Understand RAG architecture and LCEL

---

## Challenge: Personal Knowledge Base Q&A üìö

**Goal**: Build a RAG system over your own documents.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `knowledge-base-rag.ts` in the `06-rag-systems/code/` folder
2. Gather 5-10 documents about a topic you know well:
   - Personal notes
   - Blog articles you've written
   - Documentation you've created
   - Or use sample text about a hobby/interest
3. Build a RAG system that:
   - Loads and chunks the documents
   - Creates a vector store
   - Answers questions with source attribution
4. Test with 5+ questions

**Success Criteria**:
- Loads documents successfully
- Provides accurate answers from your content
- Includes source citations
- Handles questions not in the knowledge base gracefully

## Bonus Challenge: Conversational RAG üí¨

**Goal**: Build a RAG system that maintains conversation history.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `conversational-rag.ts`
2. Combine RAG with conversation memory
3. Allow follow-up questions that reference previous context:
   ```
   User: "What is TypeScript?"
   Bot: "TypeScript is..."
   User: "What are its main benefits?" ‚Üê Should understand "its" refers to TypeScript
   ```
4. Implement conversation history management
5. Add option to start new conversation

**Technical Hints**:
```typescript
// Combine with ConversationChain or use MessagesPlaceholder in prompt
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["system", "Answer based on context: {context}"],
  new MessagesPlaceholder("history"),
  ["human", "{input}"],
]);
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Maintains conversation context
- Handles follow-up questions correctly
- Clear indication of conversation state
- Option to reset conversation

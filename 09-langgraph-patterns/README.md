## üìñ The Business Process Analogy

**Imagine a customer support workflow:**

```
New Support Ticket Arrives
    ‚Üì
Is it a simple question? ‚Üí Yes ‚Üí Auto-respond
    ‚Üì No
Is it technical? ‚Üí Yes ‚Üí Route to Engineering
    ‚Üì No
Route to Customer Service
    ‚Üì
Needs approval? ‚Üí Yes ‚Üí Wait for Manager
    ‚Üì No
Send Response
    ‚Üì
Close Ticket
```

**Regular LangChain**: Linear chains (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C)

**LangGraph**: Workflows with:
- Branches (if/else)
- Loops (repeat until done)
- Human input (wait for approval)
- State management (remember progress)

## üéØ LangGraph: Beyond Simple Workflows

You've already seen LangGraph's power in Chapters 7 & 8:
- Chapter 7: ReAct agents with tools
- Chapter 8: Conversation memory with MemorySaver

Now we'll explore **graph patterns** for multi-step workflows.

### Patterns Covered

**Chapter 9 Focus**:
- Conditional branching and routing
- Custom state management
- Human-in-the-loop workflows
- Multi-path execution graphs
- Decision trees

## üèóÔ∏è Core Concepts

### 1. State

The data that flows through your graph, defined using `Annotation`:

```typescript
const WorkflowState = Annotation.Root({
  messages: Annotation<Message[]>({
    reducer: (left, right) => left.concat(right),
    default: () => [],
  }),
  nextStep: Annotation<string>({
    reducer: (_, right) => right ?? "",
    default: () => "",
  }),
  userInput: Annotation<string | undefined>({
    reducer: (_, right) => right,
    default: () => undefined,
  }),
});
```

### 2. Nodes

Functions that process state:

```typescript
async function analyzeQuestion(state: typeof WorkflowState.State) {
  // Process state and return updates
  return { nextStep: "processed" };
}
```

### 3. Edges

Connections between nodes:
- **Normal edges**: A always goes to B
- **Conditional edges**: Route based on state

### 4. Graph

The workflow combining nodes and edges.

## üíª Building Your First Graph

### Example 1: Simple Linear Graph

**Code**: [`code/01-simple-graph.ts`](./code/01-simple-graph.ts)

```typescript
import { StateGraph, END, Annotation } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import "dotenv/config";

// Define state using Annotation
const WorkflowState = Annotation.Root({
  input: Annotation<string>({
    reducer: (_, right) => right ?? "",
    default: () => "",
  }),
  output: Annotation<string>({
    reducer: (_, right) => right ?? "",
    default: () => "",
  }),
});

// Create nodes
async function processInput(state: typeof WorkflowState.State) {
  return { output: `Processed: ${state.input}` };
}

// Build graph
const workflow = new StateGraph(WorkflowState);

workflow.addNode("process", processInput);
workflow.addEdge("__start__" as any, "process" as any);
workflow.addEdge("process" as any, END);

const app = workflow.compile();

// Run the graph
const result = await app.invoke({ input: "Hello LangGraph!" });
console.log(result.output);
```

---

## üîÄ Conditional Logic

### Example 2: Conditional Routing

**Code**: [`code/02-conditional-graph.ts`](./code/02-conditional-graph.ts)

```typescript
import { StateGraph, END, Annotation } from "@langchain/langgraph";

// Define state using Annotation
const SupportState = Annotation.Root({
  question: Annotation<string>({
    reducer: (_, right) => right ?? "",
    default: () => "",
  }),
  category: Annotation<string>({
    reducer: (_, right) => right ?? "",
    default: () => "",
  }),
  answer: Annotation<string>({
    reducer: (_, right) => right ?? "",
    default: () => "",
  }),
});

// Categorize question
async function categorize(state: typeof SupportState.State) {
  const isTechnical = state.question.toLowerCase().includes("technical");
  return {
    category: isTechnical ? "technical" : "general",
  };
}

// Handle technical questions
async function handleTechnical(state: typeof SupportState.State) {
  return { answer: "Routing to engineering team..." };
}

// Handle general questions
async function handleGeneral(state: typeof SupportState.State) {
  return { answer: "Here's a quick answer..." };
}

// Routing function
function route(state: typeof SupportState.State): string {
  return state.category === "technical" ? "technical" : "general";
}

// Build graph
const workflow = new StateGraph(SupportState);

workflow.addNode("categorize", categorize);
workflow.addNode("technical", handleTechnical);
workflow.addNode("general", handleGeneral);

workflow.addEdge("__start__" as any, "categorize" as any);
workflow.addConditionalEdges("categorize" as any, route, {
  technical: "technical",
  general: "general",
} as any);
workflow.addEdge("technical" as any, END);
workflow.addEdge("general" as any, END);

const app = workflow.compile();

// Test it
const result = await app.invoke({
  question: "I have a technical issue with my API",
});
console.log(result.answer);
```

## üë§ Human-in-the-Loop

LangGraph's `interrupt()` function allows you to pause workflow execution and wait for human input. This is essential for:
- Approval workflows (deployments, data deletion)
- Review processes (content moderation)
- Quality control (reviewing AI outputs)
- Multi-stage workflows requiring human judgment

### Example 3: Approval Workflow with interrupt()

**Code**: [`code/03-human-in-loop.ts`](./code/03-human-in-loop.ts)

```typescript
import { StateGraph, START, END, interrupt, Command, MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";

// Node that requests human approval
workflow.addNode("requestApproval", async (state) => {
  console.log("Request:", state.request);

  // Pause execution and wait for human decision
  const decision = interrupt({
    question: "Do you approve this request?",
    details: state.request,
    options: ["approve", "reject"],
  });

  return { approved: decision === "approve" };
});

// Compile with checkpointer (required for interrupts)
const checkpointer = new MemorySaver();
const app = workflow.compile({ checkpointer });

// Run the workflow
const config = { configurable: { thread_id: "request-1" } };
let result = await app.invoke({ request: "Deploy to production" }, config);

// Check if interrupted
if (result.__interrupt__) {
  console.log("Workflow paused for approval");

  // In production: show this to user in UI, wait for response
  const humanDecision = "approve"; // From user input

  // Resume workflow with human's decision
  result = await app.invoke(new Command({ resume: humanDecision }), config);
}
```

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ **`interrupt()`** - Pauses execution at any point
- ‚úÖ **Checkpointer required** - Persists state during pause
- ‚úÖ **Resume with `Command`** - Continue from where it stopped
- ‚úÖ **Async human input** - Can wait hours/days for approval
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready** - Built for real-world approval flows

**How it works**:
1. Workflow runs until it hits `interrupt()`
2. Execution pauses, state is saved via checkpointer
3. System returns interrupt details to your application
4. Show interrupt to human (UI, notification, etc.)
5. When human responds, resume with `Command({ resume: value })`
6. Workflow continues from exact same point

## ü§ñ Agent with LangGraph

### Example 4: ReAct Agent Flow

**Code**: [`code/04-react-agent-graph.ts`](./code/04-react-agent-graph.ts)

```typescript
import { StateGraph, END, Annotation } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

// Define ReAct agent state
const AgentState = Annotation.Root({
  input: Annotation<string>({
    reducer: (_, right) => right ?? "",
    default: () => "",
  }),
  thought: Annotation<string>({
    reducer: (_, right) => right ?? "",
    default: () => "",
  }),
  action: Annotation<string>({
    reducer: (_, right) => right ?? "",
    default: () => "",
  }),
  actionInput: Annotation<string>({
    reducer: (_, right) => right ?? "",
    default: () => "",
  }),
  observation: Annotation<string>({
    reducer: (_, right) => right ?? "",
    default: () => "",
  }),
  answer: Annotation<string>({
    reducer: (_, right) => right ?? "",
    default: () => "",
  }),
  iterations: Annotation<number>({
    reducer: (_, right) => right ?? 0,
    default: () => 0,
  }),
});

async function think(state: typeof AgentState.State) {
  // Agent decides what to do next
  return { thought: "I should use a tool..." };
}

async function act(state: typeof AgentState.State) {
  // Execute the action
  return { observation: "Tool result...", iterations: state.iterations + 1 };
}

function shouldContinue(state: typeof AgentState.State): string {
  if (state.iterations > 5 || state.answer) {
    return "end";
  }
  return "continue";
}

// Build ReAct loop
const workflow = new StateGraph(AgentState);

workflow.addNode("think", think);
workflow.addNode("act", act);

workflow.addEdge("__start__" as any, "think" as any);
workflow.addEdge("think" as any, "act" as any);
workflow.addConditionalEdges("act" as any, shouldContinue, {
  continue: "think",
  end: END,
} as any);

const app = workflow.compile();
```

## ‚ö° Streaming Graph Outputs

LangGraph supports multiple streaming modes for real-time feedback during workflow execution:

### Streaming Modes

```typescript
// Stream state updates after each node
for await (const chunk of await graph.stream(inputs, {
  streamMode: "updates"
})) {
  console.log("Node update:", chunk);
}

// Stream full state after each step
for await (const chunk of await graph.stream(inputs, {
  streamMode: "values"
})) {
  console.log("Current state:", chunk);
}

// Stream LLM tokens in real-time
for await (const chunk of await graph.stream(inputs, {
  streamMode: "messages"
})) {
  console.log("Token:", chunk);
}
```

**Available Modes**:
- **`values`**: Full graph state after each step
- **`updates`**: State changes after each node (most common)
- **`messages`**: LLM tokens with metadata
- **`custom`**: User-defined streaming data
- **`debug`**: Detailed execution information

**When to use streaming**:
- ‚úÖ Long-running workflows (show progress)
- ‚úÖ LLM token streaming (better UX)
- ‚úÖ Multi-step agents (visibility into reasoning)
- ‚úÖ Debugging (see graph execution flow)

## üï∞Ô∏è Time Travel for Debugging

LangGraph's checkpointing enables "time travel" - viewing and modifying past states:

```typescript
// Get execution history
const states = [];
for await (const state of graph.getStateHistory(config)) {
  states.push(state);
}

// Rewind to a previous checkpoint
const pastState = states[2];
const newConfig = await graph.updateState(pastState.config, {
  // Modify state to try different path
  topic: "alternative topic"
});

// Resume from that point
await graph.invoke(null, newConfig);
```

**Use cases**:
- üêõ Debugging failed workflows
- üîÑ Testing alternative decisions
- üìä Understanding agent reasoning
- üîç Auditing execution paths

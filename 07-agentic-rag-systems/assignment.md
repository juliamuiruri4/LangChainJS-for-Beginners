# Chapter 7 Assignment: Building Agentic RAG Systems

## Overview

Practice building modern Agentic RAG systems where AI agents intelligently decide when to search your documents versus answering from general knowledge, combining retrieval with autonomous decision-making.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Chapter 7](./README.md)
- Run all code examples
- Understand agentic RAG architecture
- Familiar with agents from [Chapter 5](../05-agents-mcp/README.md)

---

## Challenge: Personal Knowledge Base Q&A üìö

**Goal**: Build an agentic RAG system over your own documents where the agent decides when to search.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `knowledge-base-rag.ts` in the `07-agentic-rag-systems/solution/` folder
2. Gather 5-10 documents about a topic you know well:
   - Personal notes
   - Blog articles you've written
   - Documentation you've created
   - Or use sample text about a hobby/interest
3. Build an agentic RAG system that:
   - Loads and chunks the documents into a vector store
   - Creates a retrieval tool for the agent
   - Uses `createAgent()` to build an autonomous agent
   - Agent decides when to search vs answer directly
4. Test with 5+ questions - mix of general knowledge and document-specific questions

**Success Criteria**:
- Loads documents successfully
- Agent answers general questions without searching
- Agent uses retrieval tool for document-specific questions
- Provides accurate answers with intelligent decision-making
- Handles questions not in the knowledge base gracefully

**Hints**:
```typescript
// 1. Import required modules
import { ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "@langchain/classic/vectorstores/memory";
import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";
import { createAgent, HumanMessage, tool } from "langchain";
import * as z from "zod";
import "dotenv/config";

// 2. Create OpenAIEmbeddings and ChatOpenAI instances

// 3. Create an array of Document objects:
//    - Use your own content as pageContent
//    - Add metadata (title, source, etc.)

// 4. Create a MemoryVectorStore from your documents

// 5. Create a retrieval tool using tool():
//    - Define async function that searches vector store
//    - Provide clear name and description
//    - Use Zod schema for input validation
//    - Format results with source attribution

// 6. Create agent with createAgent():
//    - Pass model and tools array
//    - Agent will decide when to use retrieval tool

// 7. Test with questions that demonstrate agent decision-making:
//    - General knowledge (agent answers directly)
//    - Document-specific (agent searches)
//    - Questions not in docs (agent may search but won't find)
```

## Bonus Challenge: Conversational Agentic RAG üí¨

**Goal**: Build an agentic RAG system that maintains conversation history.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `conversational-rag.ts` in the `07-agentic-rag-systems/solution/` folder
2. Combine agentic RAG with conversation memory
3. Allow follow-up questions that reference previous context:
   ```
   User: "What is TypeScript?"
   Agent: "TypeScript is..."
   User: "What are its main benefits?" ‚Üê Agent understands "its" refers to TypeScript
   ```
4. Implement conversation history management
5. Add interactive CLI for multi-turn conversations
6. Add option to start new conversation

**Success Criteria**:
- Maintains conversation context across multiple turns
- Agent handles follow-up questions correctly
- Agent decides when to search based on conversation history
- Clear indication of conversation state
- Option to reset conversation

**Hints**:
```typescript
// 1. Import additional modules for interactive CLI
import * as readline from "readline";

// 2. Create retrieval tool as in Challenge 1

// 3. Create agent with createAgent()

// 4. Initialize empty message history array

// 5. Create readline interface for interactive input

// 6. For each user question:
//    - Add all previous messages to the messages array
//    - Add new HumanMessage with user input
//    - Invoke agent with full message history
//    - Display agent's response
//    - Add agent's response to history
//    - Continue conversation loop

// 7. Handle special commands:
//    - "exit" or "quit" to end conversation
//    - "reset" to clear history and start fresh

// 8. The agent will autonomously:
//    - Understand context from conversation history
//    - Decide when to search documents
//    - Answer follow-up questions intelligently
```

Before completing Chapter 7:

- [ ] Challenge: Personal knowledge base agentic RAG works
- [ ] Agent demonstrates intelligent decision-making (searches when needed, answers directly when possible)
- [ ] Bonus: Conversational agentic RAG maintains context (optional)

# Chapter 3 Assignment: Prompt Engineering with Templates

## Overview

Practice creating reusable, maintainable prompts using templates, few-shot learning, and composition techniques.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Chapter 3](./README.md)
- Run all code examples (including structured outputs examples)
- Understand template syntax and composition

---

## Challenge 1: Email Response Generator üìß

**Goal**: Create a template system for generating customer service email responses.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `email-generator.ts` in the `03-prompt-templates/code/` folder
2. Build a template that generates emails with:
   - Company name variable
   - Customer name variable
   - Issue type variable (refund, exchange, technical support)
   - Tone variable (formal, friendly, apologetic)
3. Test with at least 3 different scenarios
4. Print both the filled template and the AI response

**Example Scenarios**:
- Refund request - apologetic tone
- Technical support - friendly and helpful tone
- Exchange request - formal and professional tone

**Success Criteria**:
- Template is reusable for different scenarios
- Generated emails match the requested tone
- All variables are properly substituted

## Challenge 2: Few-Shot Format Teacher üéì

**Goal**: Use few-shot prompting to teach the AI a custom output format.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `format-teacher.ts`
2. Teach the AI to convert product descriptions into a specific JSON format:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Product name",
     "price": "$XX.XX",
     "category": "Category",
     "highlight": "Key feature"
   }
   ```
3. Provide 3-4 example conversions
4. Test with new product descriptions
5. Parse and validate the JSON output

**Teaching Examples** (provide these as few-shot examples):
- Input: "Premium wireless headphones with noise cancellation, $199"
- Input: "Organic cotton t-shirt in blue, comfortable fit, $29.99"
- Input: "Gaming laptop with RTX 4070, 32GB RAM, $1,499"

**Success Criteria**:
- AI consistently outputs valid JSON
- Format matches your examples
- Works with various product descriptions

## Challenge 3: Multi-Language Translation System üåç

**Goal**: Build a translation system that supports multiple language pairs.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `translator.ts`
2. Build a template system that:
   - Supports at least 5 target languages
   - Includes context about formality level (casual/formal)
   - Handles both single sentences and paragraphs
   - Shows the source language and target language clearly
3. Create a menu-driven interface (using readline) where users can:
   - Select target language
   - Choose formality level
   - Enter text to translate
4. Display formatted results

**Languages to Support**:
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Japanese
- Italian

**Success Criteria**:
- Users can select language and formality
- Translations reflect formality level
- Clear, formatted output
- Template is reusable across all language pairs

## Challenge 4: Dynamic Prompt Builder üèóÔ∏è

**Goal**: Create a system that composes prompts dynamically based on user preferences.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `prompt-builder.ts`
2. Build a modular prompt system with these composable pieces:
   - **Role options**: Teacher, Expert, Friend, Professional
   - **Style options**: Concise, Detailed, Creative, Technical
   - **Format options**: Bullet points, Paragraph, Step-by-step, Q&A
3. Let users select their preferences
4. Compose a final template from their choices
5. Test with the same question using different combinations

**Example Question**: "How does photosynthesis work?"

**Test Combinations**:
- Teacher + Detailed + Step-by-step
- Expert + Technical + Bullet points
- Friend + Concise + Paragraph

**Success Criteria**:
- All combinations work correctly
- Responses clearly reflect chosen options
- System is easily extensible (can add new options)
- Display which combination was used for each response

## Bonus Challenge: Prompt Template Library üìö

**Goal**: Create a reusable library of prompt templates for common tasks.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `template-library.ts`
2. Build a collection of at least 5 reusable templates for:
   - Code explanation
   - Text summarization
   - Creative writing prompts
   - Data formatting
   - Question answering
3. Create a CLI that:
   - Lists available templates
   - Lets users select a template
   - Prompts for required variables
   - Executes and displays result
4. Make it easy to add new templates

**Example Templates**:
```typescript
const templates = {
  codeExplainer: ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([...]),
  summarizer: ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([...]),
  // ... more templates
};
```

**Success Criteria**:
- At least 5 working templates
- Clean CLI interface
- Easy to add new templates
- All templates properly handle variables

## Bonus Challenge 2: Product Data Extractor with Structured Outputs üè∑Ô∏è

**Goal**: Build a system that extracts product information into validated, typed data structures.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `product-extractor.ts`
2. Define a Zod schema for product information:
   ```typescript
   {
     name: string,
     price: number,
     category: string (enum: Electronics, Clothing, Food, Books, Home),
     inStock: boolean,
     rating: number (1-5),
     features: string[]
   }
   ```
3. Use `withStructuredOutput()` to extract product data
4. Test with product descriptions in various formats:
   - Formal product listings
   - Casual marketplace descriptions
   - Mixed content (reviews + specifications)
5. Validate that all outputs match your schema
6. Handle edge cases (missing information)

**Example Inputs**:
- "MacBook Pro 16-inch with M3 chip, $2,499. Currently in stock. Users rate it 4.8/5. Features: Liquid Retina display, 18-hour battery, 1TB SSD"
- "Cozy wool sweater, blue color, medium size. $89, available now! Customers love it - 4.5 stars. Hand-washable, made in Ireland"
- "The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Classic novel, paperback edition for $12.99. In stock. Rated 4.9 stars. 180 pages, published 1925"

**Success Criteria**:
- All outputs are properly typed
- Schema validation works correctly
- Handles various input formats
- Correctly categorizes products
- Gracefully handles missing data

# Chapter 5 Assignment: Function Calling & Tooling

## Overview

Practice creating type-safe tools with Zod schemas, implementing the complete tool execution pattern, and building multi-tool systems that extend AI capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Chapter 5](./README.md)
- Run all four code examples
- Understand tool creation, binding, and execution

---

## Challenge: Weather Tool with Complete Execution Loop ‚õÖ

**Goal**: Build a weather tool and implement the complete 3-step execution pattern (generate ‚Üí execute ‚Üí respond).

**Tasks**:
1. Create `weather-tool.ts` in the `05-function-calling-tooling/code/` folder
2. Build a weather tool with Zod schema that accepts:
   - `city` (string, required) - The city name
   - `units` (enum: "celsius" or "fahrenheit", optional, default: "fahrenheit") - Temperature unit
3. Implement the tool to return simulated weather data for at least 5 cities
4. Implement the complete 3-step execution pattern:
   - **Step 1**: Get tool call from LLM
   - **Step 2**: Execute the tool
   - **Step 3**: Send result back to LLM for final response
5. Test with multiple queries using different cities and units

**Example Queries**:
- "What's the weather in Tokyo?"
- "Tell me the temperature in Paris in celsius"
- "Is it raining in London?"

**Success Criteria**:
- Tool uses proper Zod schema with `.describe()` for parameters
- Handles both celsius and fahrenheit units
- Implements all 3 steps of tool execution
- LLM generates natural language responses based on tool results
- Clear console output showing each step

**Hints**:
```typescript
schema: z.object({
  city: z.string().describe("City name, e.g., 'Tokyo' or 'Paris'"),
  units: z.enum(["celsius", "fahrenheit"]).optional().describe("Temperature unit")
})
```

## Bonus Challenge: Multi-Tool Travel Assistant üåç

**Goal**: Build a system with multiple tools where the LLM automatically selects the appropriate tool for travel-related queries.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `travel-assistant.ts`
2. Build three specialized tools:
   - **Currency Converter**: Convert amounts between currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY)
   - **Distance Calculator**: Calculate distance between two cities in miles or kilometers
   - **Time Zone Tool**: Get current time in a city and calculate time difference
3. Each tool should have:
   - Clear, descriptive name
   - Detailed description explaining when to use it
   - Proper Zod schema with parameter descriptions
4. Bind all three tools to the model
5. Test with queries that require different tools:
   - "Convert 100 USD to EUR"
   - "What's the distance between New York and London?"
   - "What time is it in Tokyo right now?"
   - "If it's 3pm in Seattle, what time is it in Paris?"

**Success Criteria**:
- All three tools work correctly
- LLM automatically chooses the right tool for each query
- Tool descriptions are clear enough to guide LLM selection
- Returns accurate simulated results
- Handles edge cases (invalid currencies, unknown cities)

**Advanced Feature** (Optional):
Add error handling that returns helpful error messages when:
- Invalid currency code provided
- Unknown city name
- Invalid input format

**Example Output**:
```
Query: "Convert 50 EUR to JPY"
‚Üí LLM chose: currencyConverter
‚Üí Args: { amount: 50, from: "EUR", to: "JPY" }
‚Üí Result: "50 EUR equals approximately 8,100 JPY"

Query: "What's the distance from Paris to Rome?"
‚Üí LLM chose: distanceCalculator
‚Üí Args: { from: "Paris", to: "Rome", units: "kilometers" }
‚Üí Result: "The distance from Paris to Rome is approximately 1,430 kilometers"
```

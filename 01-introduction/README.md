## 📖 Introduction: The Hardware Store Analogy

**Imagine you're building a house.** You could manufacture your own bricks, create cement from scratch, and forge your own tools—or you could use a hardware store that provides quality materials and proven tools.

**LangChain.js is the hardware store for AI development.**

Just like a hardware store provides:
- 🔨 **Pre-made tools** (hammers, saws, drills)
- 🧱 **Quality materials** (lumber, nails, paint)
- 📋 **Blueprints** (how-to guides)
- 🔄 **Interchangeable parts** (standard sizes that work together)

LangChain.js provides:
- 🔨 **Pre-built components** (chat models, prompts, chains)
- 🧱 **Quality abstractions** (works with any LLM provider)
- 📋 **Patterns** (common AI application designs)
- 🔄 **Composability** (components that work together seamlessly)

**The result?** You can focus on building your application, not reinventing the wheel.

## 🧠 What is LangChain.js?

LangChain.js is a **framework for building AI-powered applications** using Large Language Models (LLMs).

### The Problem It Solves

Without LangChain.js, you'd need to:
- Write different code for each LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, etc.)
- Build your own prompt management system
- Create custom chains for multi-step operations
- Implement memory and conversation handling from scratch
- Build agent systems without any structure

### The LangChain.js Solution

With LangChain.js, you get:
- ✅ **Provider abstraction** - Switch between OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic with minimal code changes
- ✅ **Prompt templates** - Reusable, testable prompts
- ✅ **Chains** - Combine multiple operations seamlessly
- ✅ **Memory** - Built-in conversation history
- ✅ **Agents** - Decision-making AI that can use tools

---

## 🏗️ Core Concepts Overview

LangChain.js is built around 5 main concepts:

### 1. Models

Models are the AI "brains" that generate text, embeddings, or other outputs.

**Types**:
- **Chat Models**: Conversational AI (GPT-4o, Claude, etc.)
- **LLMs**: Text completion models
- **Embedding Models**: Convert text to vector representations

### 2. Prompts

Prompts are instructions you give to the model.

**LangChain.js helps with**:
- Template creation
- Variable substitution
- Few-shot examples
- Prompt composition

### 3. Chains (LCEL - LangChain Expression Language)

Chains connect multiple operations together.

**Example**: Retrieve documents → Format them → Send to LLM → Parse output

### 4. Agents

Agents are AI systems that can make decisions and use tools.

**Example**: An agent that can search the web, perform calculations, and send emails.

### 5. Memory

Memory allows AI to remember conversation context.

**Example**: A chatbot that remembers your name and previous questions.

## 💻 Hands-On: Your First LLM Call

Let's make your first AI call using LangChain.js and GitHub Models!

### Example 1: Hello World

In this example, you'll create your first LangChain.js program that sends a simple message to an AI model and displays the response.

**Code**: [`code/01-hello-world.ts`](./code/01-hello-world.ts)
**Run**: `tsx 01-introduction/code/01-hello-world.ts`

This example shows the simplest possible LangChain.js application:

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import "dotenv/config";

async function main() {
  console.log("🚀 Hello LangChain.js!\n");

  // Create a model instance using environment variables
  const model = new ChatOpenAI({
    model: process.env.AI_MODEL || "gpt-4o-mini",
    configuration: {
      baseURL: process.env.AI_ENDPOINT,
    },
    apiKey: process.env.AI_API_KEY,
  });

  // Make your first AI call!
  const response = await model.invoke("What is LangChain in one sentence?");

  console.log("🤖 AI Response:", response.content);
  console.log("\n✅ Success! You just made your first LangChain.js call!");
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### Expected Output

When you run this example with `tsx 01-introduction/code/01-hello-world.ts`, you'll see:

```
🚀 Hello LangChain.js!

🤖 AI Response: LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

✅ Success! You just made your first LangChain.js call!
```

### How It Works

**What's happening here?**
1. We import `ChatOpenAI` from LangChain
2. We create a model instance using environment variables (`AI_API_KEY`, `AI_ENDPOINT`, `AI_MODEL`)
3. We call `invoke()` with a simple string prompt
4. We get back a response with the AI's answer

**Why environment variables?** This allows you to switch between providers (GitHub Models, Azure AI Foundry, OpenAI) by just changing your `.env` file - no code changes needed!

## 💬 Understanding Messages

LLMs work best with structured conversations. LangChain.js provides message types for this.

### Example 2: Message Types

This example shows you how to use structured message types (SystemMessage and HumanMessage) to control AI behavior and maintain conversation context.

**Code**: [`code/02-message-types.ts`](./code/02-message-types.ts)
**Run**: `tsx 01-introduction/code/02-message-types.ts`

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { HumanMessage, SystemMessage, AIMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
import "dotenv/config";

async function main() {
  console.log("🎭 Understanding Message Types\n");

  const model = new ChatOpenAI({
    model: process.env.AI_MODEL || "gpt-4o-mini",
    configuration: {
      baseURL: process.env.AI_ENDPOINT,
    },
    apiKey: process.env.AI_API_KEY,
  });

  // Using structured messages
  const messages = [
    new SystemMessage("You are a helpful AI assistant who explains things simply."),
    new HumanMessage("Explain quantum computing to a 10-year-old."),
  ];

  const response = await model.invoke(messages);
  console.log("🤖 AI Response:", response.content);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### Expected Output

When you run this example with `tsx 01-introduction/code/02-message-types.ts`, you'll see:

```
🎭 Understanding Message Types

🤖 AI Response: Quantum computing is like having a super-fast magic box that can try many different solutions to a puzzle at the same time! While regular computers look at one answer at a time, quantum computers can explore lots of possibilities all at once, which helps them solve really hard problems much faster.
```

### How It Works

**Message Types**:
- **SystemMessage**: Sets the AI's behavior and personality
- **HumanMessage**: User input
- **AIMessage**: The AI's responses (usually added automatically)

**What's happening**:
1. The SystemMessage tells the AI to explain things simply (like to a beginner)
2. The HumanMessage contains the user's question about quantum computing
3. The AI crafts a response that matches the system instruction (simple explanation)
4. Because we set the personality in the SystemMessage, the response is age-appropriate and clear

**Why use messages instead of strings?**
- Better control over AI behavior
- Maintains conversation context
- More powerful and flexible

## 🔄 Comparing Models

GitHub Models gives you access to multiple AI models. Let's compare them!

### Example 3: Model Comparison

Here you'll compare responses from different AI models (gpt-4o vs gpt-4o-mini) to understand their capabilities, speed, and output quality differences.

**Code**: [`code/03-model-comparison.ts`](./code/03-model-comparison.ts)
**Run**: `tsx 01-introduction/code/03-model-comparison.ts`

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import "dotenv/config";

async function compareModels() {
  console.log("🔬 Comparing AI Models\n");

  const prompt = "Explain recursion in programming in one sentence.";
  const models = ["gpt-4o", "gpt-4o-mini"];

  for (const modelName of models) {
    console.log(`\n📊 Testing: ${modelName}`);
    console.log("─".repeat(50));

    const model = new ChatOpenAI({
      model: modelName,
      configuration: {
        baseURL: process.env.AI_ENDPOINT,
      },
      apiKey: process.env.AI_API_KEY,
    });

    const response = await model.invoke(prompt);
    console.log(`Response: ${response.content}`);
  }

  console.log("\n✅ Comparison complete!");
}

compareModels().catch(console.error);
```

### Expected Output

When you run this example with `tsx 01-introduction/code/03-model-comparison.ts`, you'll see:

```
🔬 Comparing AI Models


📊 Testing: gpt-4o
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Response: Recursion in programming is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem until it reaches a base case.


📊 Testing: gpt-4o-mini
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Response: Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar sub-problems.

✅ Comparison complete!
```

### How It Works

**What's happening**:
1. We define a single prompt asking about recursion
2. We loop through two different models: `gpt-4o` and `gpt-4o-mini`
3. For each model, we create a new `ChatOpenAI` instance with that model name
4. We invoke the same prompt on each model
5. We display the response from each model for comparison

**What you'll notice**:
- Different models have different response styles
- `gpt-4o` tends to be more detailed and sophisticated
- `gpt-4o-mini` is more concise but still accurate
- Both answers are correct, just expressed differently
- `gpt-4o` is more capable for complex tasks, `gpt-4o-mini` is faster and cheaper for simple tasks

## 🔄 Switching to Azure AI Foundry (Optional)

**Want to use Azure AI Foundry instead of GitHub Models?** Great news - all the code you just wrote will work with zero changes!

### Why Switch to Azure AI Foundry?

- ✅ **Production-ready**: Enterprise-grade infrastructure and SLAs
- ✅ **Higher limits**: More requests per minute than free tiers
- ✅ **Advanced features**: Private endpoints, content filtering, monitoring
- ✅ **Azure integration**: Works seamlessly with other Azure services

### How to Switch

Simply update your `.env` file with three values:

```bash
# OLD: GitHub Models (Free)
AI_API_KEY=ghp_your_github_token
AI_ENDPOINT=https://models.inference.ai.azure.com
AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# NEW: Azure AI Foundry (Production)
AI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_api_key
AI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

**That's it!** All examples in this chapter (and the entire course) now use Azure AI Foundry.

### Getting Your Azure AI Foundry Credentials

1. **Create** an Azure AI Foundry project at [ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com)
2. **Deploy** a model (e.g., gpt-4o-mini)
3. **Copy** your endpoint and API key from the Azure Portal

**Your endpoint** looks like: `https://YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME.openai.azure.com`

**Model name** matches your deployment name (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`)

### The Magic of Provider Abstraction ✨

Notice that your code uses environment variables:

```typescript
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: process.env.AI_MODEL || "gpt-4o-mini",
  configuration: {
    baseURL: process.env.AI_ENDPOINT,
  },
  apiKey: process.env.AI_API_KEY,
});
```

This pattern means:
- ✅ **No code changes** to switch providers
- ✅ **Easy testing** - Use GitHub Models for dev, Azure for production
- ✅ **Cost optimization** - Switch to cheaper providers when appropriate
- ✅ **Disaster recovery** - Fallback to alternative providers if one is down

You'll learn more about production deployment strategies in [Chapter 10](../10-production-best-practices/README.md).
